# Data-Science-Multi-Projects

This repository contains several subprojects, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis and machine learning. The projects cover data visualization, analysis, cleaning, standardization, dimensionality reduction, classification, regression, and clustering. Each subproject has been organized into separate zip files representing the relevant python files. These were done as part of Data Science 3 (IC 272) course at IIT Mandi.

#### Task 1: Data Visualization and Statistics from Data
#### Task 2: Data Cleaning â€“ Handling Missing Values and Outlier Analyses
#### Task 3: Attribute normalization, standardization and dimension reduction of data
#### Task 4: Data Classification using K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier and Bayes Classifier with Unimodal Gaussian Density
#### Task 5: Data classification using Bayes Classifier with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM); Regression using Simple Linear Regression and Polynomial Curve Fitting
#### Task 6: Autoregression
#### Task 7: Clustering
